Created By Group 5 - Cooking Assistant Application 

## Project Description
This cooking assistant app is made for use by a wide variety of individuals with differing skill and experience in the kitchen. It excels in making recipe discovery intuitive and enjoyable while ensuring viewing them is just as fun and easy. Even better it removes the complexity of searching for specific recipes on the internet using intuitive filtering and a natural search process. We pride ourselves on its intuitive use, organized structure, and the simplicity it brings to making a meal.
